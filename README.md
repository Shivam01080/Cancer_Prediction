# Breast Cancer Prediction App

## Overview
The **Breast Cancer Prediction App** is a web application built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on user-provided input features. The prediction is made using a **machine learning model** trained on a breast cancer dataset.

## Features
- User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**
- Predicts whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**
- Uses a trained **Machine Learning model**
- Provides **probability scores** for predictions
- **Real-time** predictions with easy-to-understand results

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-learn** (for Machine Learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, which is publicly available in the `sklearn.datasets` module. It includes features such as:
- **Radius**
- **Texture**
- **Perimeter**
- **Area**
- **Smoothness**, etc.

## How It Works
1. The user enters the required **features** in the Streamlit interface.
2. The application processes the inputs and feeds them into the **trained ML model**.
3. The model predicts whether the tumor is **Malignant** (cancerous) or **Benign** (non-cancerous).
4. The result is displayed on the screen along with a probability score.

## Deployment
The app is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**. You can access it [Breast-Cancer-Prediction](https://your-app-name.streamlit.app/](https://cancerprediction-uxdmvfvxaft6dsmb3qh4a8.streamlit.app/).

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the model with **deep learning** techniques.
- Add an **Explainable AI** (XAI) feature to interpret predictions.
- Deploy as a **REST API** for wider integration.
